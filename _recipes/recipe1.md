## Ingredients

* 225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
* Salt
* 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* Ground ginger
* Cinnamon 
* 75g unsalted butter
* 100g soft brown sugar
* 100g golden syrup

## Method

* STEP 1

  Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and line a [baking tray](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/kimberley-wilsons-top-5-baking-trays) with baking parchment. Sieve the flour, salt, bicarb, ginger and cinnamon into a large bowl. Heat the butter, sugar and syrup until dissolved. Leave the sugar mixture to cool slightly, then mix into the dry ingredients to form a dough. Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 mins.
* STEP 2

  On a surface lightly dusted with flour, roll out the dough to a ¼-inch thickness. Stamp out the gingerbread men shapes with a cutter, then re-roll any off-cuts and repeat. Place your gingerbread shapes on the lined trays, allowing space for them to spread. Cook for 10-15 mins, then remove from the oven and leave to cool.
